# Digital-Experiments
This repository contains interactive "digital experiments" that are used within our teaching of Compressible Flows to undergraduate students at the University of Birmingham.

_fanno_curve.html_ illustrates the Mollier diagram (h-s) for subsonic and supersonic flows in the presence of friction

_rayleigh_curve.htm_ illustrates the Mollier diagram (h-s) for subsonic and supersonic flows in the presence of heat addition

_nozzle_simulator.html_ shows the effect of changing the pressure ratio on the flow within the diverging section of a nozzle
